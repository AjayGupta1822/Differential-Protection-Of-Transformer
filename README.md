# Differential-Protection-Of-Transformer
Developed a cost-effective and efficient transformer protection system using Arduino. Implemented differential relay logic to detect internal faults within the transformer. Employed current sensors to monitor input and output currents, with Arduino processing the data to identify discrepancies indicative of faults.
